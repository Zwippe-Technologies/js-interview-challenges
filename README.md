# Usage
This project has two files with interview questions:
 - [Array Questions](./src/01-arrays.js)
 - [Promise Questions](./src/02-promises.js)

In each file there are challenges that you can solve.

For testing purposes, you can use the [test runner](./index.js) that prints in console the result of each challenge:
```
npm run start
```
